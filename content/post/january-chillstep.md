I’ve recently discovered this lovely new feature that SoundCloud has: sets. So, thinking “Hey, a playlist feature! Yawn…”, I idly clicked some tracks and added them to a “Set” but apparently it’s a bit more than that. It’s a ‘social playlist’, after a fashion, that you can publish to the world. Nothing new and ground-breaking, sure, but still undeniably cool.

So here’s some things I mashed together into a dubstep / chillstep playlist and think are delightful and make your brain turn in fun new ways.
