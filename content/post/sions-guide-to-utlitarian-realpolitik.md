I recently resubscribed to EVE Online (a Terrible Spacehip Game In Space) and re-joined my old alliance, Goonswarm Federation. Catching up on what’s been going on, I came across this talk by Sion Kumitomo, our chief diplomat.

Diplomacy is a hugely important factor in how the GSF ascended to where it is right now and has remained there, even after being almost destroyed.

As player presentations go, this is one of the best I’ve seen in a long time. Sion is a very good presenter and, oh, that voice. It’s like having space honey in your ears.
