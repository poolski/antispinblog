Kev from Spinning@ kindly donated some more music to my repository of ‘things I listen to when I do stuff’. It’s fairly extensive. The genre in question is Electro Swing. From what I can gather from listening, it’s a delicious fusion of splendid dancy jazzy swing and machines and synth noises. It really is something special and a lot of fun
