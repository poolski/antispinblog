I’ve not the time right now to write more in the [Logstash](http://antisp.in/2014/03/getting-started-with-logstash/ "Getting started with Logstash") [series](http://antisp.in/2014/03/logstash-forwarder/ "Logstash part 1.1: logstash-forwarder"), but as a quick interlude, I’d like to link to my ever-expanding Gist containing some useful Logstash GROK patterns for Postfix and Sendmail. Good, comprehensive sets of these are a bit of a slog to find online, so I cobbled together some from posts on the Internets, GitHub Gists and some tweaks of my own to make them work.

Presented as-is and there’s no guarantee they’ll work for you. You may have to tweak them.

I’d recommend getting intimate with [grokDebug](http://grokdebug.herokuapp.com/) for when you start writing your own patterns.
