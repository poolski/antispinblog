I came across this lovely ambient tune while listening to Groove Salad on SomaFM. SomaFM is a great electronic music station that’s got a loyal following of thousands of connoisseurs of electronica, ambient beats and almighty chill.

It’s a bit repetitive, but it’s lovely to have running in the background while you stare at the sky or lie with your eyes close and untangle the melodies as I love doing.

Whereas this tune is just plain catchy. Yes it’s a tad mainstream, but it reminds me of the summer to come and fun things!
