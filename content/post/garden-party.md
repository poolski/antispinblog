So Kat and I shot a bunch of footage at the last Epic Garden Party and havenâ€™t had a chance to edit it. We recently got together and did some hardcore Premiere sessions in which she taught me a bunch of awesome things. I did some tweaking and post-production of my own and we ended up with this:

<object height="361" width="600"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/qwIHLqwXEeM?fs=1&hl=en_GB"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always"></param><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="361" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/qwIHLqwXEeM?fs=1&hl=en_GB" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="600"></embed></object>

Pretty nifty, I feel!
