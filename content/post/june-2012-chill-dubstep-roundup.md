It’s been a while since I’ve done one of these, so here’s a quick rundown of various chill dubstep/2-step tunes I’ve been listening to that are well worth checking out!

Above & Beyond delivering more ethereal vocals combined with epic drops! It sounds like it could be a standard trance track they’d blast out in clubs, but it’s wonderfully surprising!

This one came from a contact juggling video by Cyrille & Kyle. It starts off really quiet and gives no hint that there’s some freaky wobbly bass hiding in there!

Patrick Reza’s remix of Lana Del Rey’s Blue Jeans is fairly standard dubstep remix fare, but it’s a hell of a good tune to spin to!

J-One whips up yet more delightful minimal dubstep/2-step stuff!

These two tracks are an absolute joy to listen to. No intrusive over-the-top synths but with a delicious bassline.
