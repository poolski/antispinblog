[Polymagnet](http://www.polymagnet.com/) have come up with a way to “print” magnetic fields on a surface of a magnet, with North and South poles and field lines terminating on the same face. This allows, for instance for much greater attachment strength and magnets which can simultaneously repel and attract on the same face. The attraction/repulsion depends on the relative orientation of each magnet relative to its corresponding pair.

The applications of this tech are far-reaching enough that they haven’t really worked out what to do with it yet.

Science!
