My friend Ren√©e pointed me at Addictech.com which is an amazing resource for finding new delicious noises to play. Anyhow, we got talking and while exploring the site, I came across this guy: DCarls, who created a couple of gems that I knew I had to have straight away.

Imagine my lack shock and surprise, then, at how good these tunes are!
