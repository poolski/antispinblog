After ages and ages of playing with my camera, getting some great shots and really enjoying them, I realised that all I did was dump them to my hard drive, edit them and then utterly fail to share any of them! So, in order to remedy that, here are a bunch of cool shots that I took at various stages but have forgotten to reveal, **until now**

It’s great to dig through and find shots you’ve forgotten about! It’s like digging for treasure, except you know where you should start looking and the treasure is often pretty!

I’ll try to post more of these “Photo Archive” blogs in future!
