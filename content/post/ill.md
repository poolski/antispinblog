Thanks to the antics of the questionably sane National Express coach drivers on the 12-hour ride down from Aberdeen – namely putting the air conditioning on ‘cold’ when it was *sub zero* outside – I now have some horrendous viral infection.

It could be bird flu or Ebola or AIDS for all I know! There is no possible chance it’s the Common Cold. That’s too easy.

Thanks, National Express. I hope you’re happy.  
 Me – not so much.
