Someone at work plugged this bad boy into the sound system and it’s sublime! Röyksopp never fails to make more awesome. The buildup in this tune is spectacular but doesn’t leave you waiting as much as some tunes do, for which I have massive respect. Also, it strikes me as a badass tribal bellydance tune! Listen, enjoy, comment, share!
