Citymapper is a relatively new app that’s been brought to my attention recently and it’s what Android has been craving for a long time. Compared to most other ‘travel planners’ that are out there on the Play Store, this outshines them all by miles.

It’s been argued for a long time that app developers really ought to be paying more attention to the UX design of their products, instead of being function-driven. A great UI/UX fusion will go a very long way.

It’s the little details that leap out at me in this app:

- <span style="line-height: 15px;">Swiping to the local bus or tube stop list will give you an overview of what’s around along with **estimated walking times**, which are a lovely touch.</span>
- Tapping on a stop will give you an at-a-glance view of the next couple departures. Swiping left gives you **walking directions** to the stop you’re looking at.
- Hitting “Get me somewhere” or “Get me home” will give you a list of possible routes, along with journey times and **oyster card costs** for your journey. <span style="font-weight: 600;">  
</span>
- Looking at the tube status page not only gives you a quick view of what’s going on along with service updates but also lets you know **which****station is the nearest** to you on any of the listed lines and how long it’ll take you to walk there

None of these features are compulsory, really; the app works pretty well without them

Get the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.citymapper.app.release) and/or the [iTunes App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/citymapper-london-transport/id469463298?mt=8).

With this in mind, allow me to present Citymapper.
