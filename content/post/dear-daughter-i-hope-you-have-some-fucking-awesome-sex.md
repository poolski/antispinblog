If I ever become a parent, I will do my damndest to do this. Other humans’ lives are not mine to control. I can provide advice, describe what worked for me in the past and offer a stable, safe space to return to when shit hits the fan.

However, dictating what other people, especially any potential kids of mine, do to the extent of “you will have sex when I say it’s OK for you to have sex” is abhorrent.
