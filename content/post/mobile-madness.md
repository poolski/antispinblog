I just installed a nifty tool on my G1 which allows me to post stuff from my phone wherever I am. Scary!

It’s like Twitter Lite!

Hope you enjoyed my web design post – I have another in the works about how to keep your data safe and prevent data loss. If you haven’t already, I’d suggest joining [DPS](https://digital-photography-school.com/forum/) where you’ll find a slew of useful photography tips.

See you next time!
