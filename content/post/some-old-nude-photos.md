About this time last year, I shot a bunch of nude photos with a friend of mine for her life modelling portfolio as she needed to get pictures to people. It was such a delightful evening as there’s something really great about doing a photoshoot with a close friend and taking things slowly with plenty of breaks for wine and hugs and the like!

One of the things I plan on doing when I go back to Canada is doing another glamorous photoshoot – maybe even somewhere in the woods for that added touch of wildness in the images. Ideas, ideas!
