In the wise words of Baudelaire:

> One should always be drunk.  
>  That is all that matters;  
>  That’s our imperative need.
> 
> So as not to feel time’s horrible burden  
>  One which breaks your shoulders and bows you down  
>  You must get drunk without cease
> 
> But with what?  
>  Wine, poetry or virtue as you choose.  
>  But get drunk.

It’s a gorgeous day and I’m off to play in the sun.
