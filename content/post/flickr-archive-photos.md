After ages and ages of playing with my camera, getting some great shots and really enjoying them, I realised that all I did was dump them to my hard drive, edit them and then utterly fail to share any of them! So, in order to remedy that, here are a bunch of cool shots that I took at various stages but have forgotten to reveal, **until now**

It’s great to dig through and find shots you’ve forgotten about! It’s like digging for treasure, except you know where you should start looking and the treasure is often pretty!
