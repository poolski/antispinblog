I was at a friend’s house over the weekend and since my new EOS 60D arrived last week, I spent a large chunk of time playing with it and getting to grips with its various quirks and foibles. There aren’t many, thankfully. I also wound up shooting lots of macro shots of bits of plants and I must say, I’m very impressed with the performance overall!
