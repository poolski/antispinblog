I have a whole bunch of things to share this time around. I’ve been largely ignoring this blog, except as a glorified link dump. Which has worked surprisingly well, actually!

So today, I have not only music, but awesome miscellanea to share with the Internets. The first thing is Welder’s new track:

It’s pretty relaxed and takes a while to wind up to full speed, but it’s wonderful to listen to. I can see it being a great track to spin and dance to, which I plan to do at some point soon! I’m intentionally not listening to it on repeat on my iPod so I can avoid getting bored with the sound!

Next is a [site that a friend linked me to](https://thisiscolossal.com/) – which is a great collection of awesome design that stalks the Interwebs!
