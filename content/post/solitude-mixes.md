My friend Tina pointed me at this rather incredible DJ who periodically makes very chilled dubstep-y mixes. The mixes are over an hour and a half long and they flow from incredibly chilled to energetic without being in-your-face like a lot of dubstep is. To me, the difference between full-on *‘wob-wob-wob-wob’* dubstep and the more relaxed flavours is that while the former assaults your senses with sound, the latter has some spaces in the music for your thoughts and lets you experience the music better as you aren’t trying to fight off waves of sensory overload.

Here’s a great sample:
