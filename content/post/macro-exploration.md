<figcaption class="caption wp-caption-text">That dreaded message</figcaption></figure>I had a very narrow escape with these photos. Midway through my photo walkabout, the camera flashed up this dreaded message. So I promptly shut my camera down, and prayed. Fortunately, I was able to recover the images from the card, for the most part, thanks to PhotoRec, a free piece of SD card recovery software that does block-level scans of the SD card and pieces together your files. Or something. Either way, I was able to pull the images from it and now you get to see!
