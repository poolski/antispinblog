I came across this tiny snippet of a TED video on the youtubes and rather unsurprisingly, it’s stupendous!

It sort of mirrors how I came to be at this point in my life – by saying “yes” to stuff and trying new things, even if they seem somewhat far-fetched.

It’s how I got round to going to Burning Man, despite never having been and being completely out of my depth. Not only that, but I’m going to the desert for **two** weeks to help a friend build his [art project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1705373243/the-pier-burning-man-2011-art-installation?ref=live "The Pier 2011"). There is no way I’d have gone out there if I hadn’t just said “yeah sure, what the hell”.
