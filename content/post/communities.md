Hello!!

After much procrastination, sitting around on my arse and pawing ineffectually at the screen like a slack-jawed Luddite, I’ve sorted us out a website after Jan poked me and bribed me with Pretzels!

<div class="mceTemp mceIEcenter"><dl class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_180" style="width: 544px;"><dt class="wp-caption-dt">
![](https://burnthebeach.com/)
</dt></dl></div>It’s essentially a blog and community site for the firespinning folk I’m friends with to hang out, post pictures, musings and so forth. Also, since we do Burn The Beach meets on a regular basis, I thought a website would be cool for when people invariably ask “Who ARE you guys?!”
