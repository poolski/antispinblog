A while ago, I joined this awesome collaborative production company called HitRecord. It’s *a little bit different.*

It’s a **collaborative** production company. Think open source, Creative Commons and a whole bunch of delightful humans rolled into one package.

- Anyone can join.
- Anyone can contribute.
- As long as it’s your own work.

It leads to some incredible collaborations like this:

…that arise from someone writing a short story, then someone else drawing a couple of character illustrations, then *someone else* recording a reading of the story, then someone else recording a live green-screened rendition

Anyway, now, they’re doing a TV show! I’m exceptionally excited to see what comes out of it!
