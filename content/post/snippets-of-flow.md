My friend Mandy has kindly put up all **2337** photos she took in Bali. And some videos. Honestly, there were far too many amazing shots to list, but here are some choice picks for your perusal. All credit goes to her. Check out the rest of the series right [here on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/41117961@N05/collections/72157623660460046/ "Bali 2010")
