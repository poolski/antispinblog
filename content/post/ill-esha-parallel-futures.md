Came across this on Beatport – it’s a track on [Simplify Records](https://simplifyrecordings.com) and it’s a lovely dark, moody, yet chilled dubstep-ish sort of noise. Well worth a listen to. It’s a great mix between the almost grimy side of dubstep and delicious acoustic sounds without assaulting your senses!

[Grab it on Beatport](https://www.beatport.com/track/parallel-futures-original-mix/2028229) if you want to support the artist! Honestly, do it. It’ll make you a better human being, somehow!
