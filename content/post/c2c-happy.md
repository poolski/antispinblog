C2C are a collective of four French DJs/turntablists who make exceptionally energetic and exciting mixes like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpc3cCxWNkU "Down The Road").

Recently I re-discovered another track they did called Happy. The music and mixing are, naturally, top-notch but even more amazing is the choreography and the dancing. I’m pretty certain that the lead guy is the same dude that did [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXO-jKksQkM "Pumped Up Kicks").

Anyway: judge for yourselves. C2C – Happy (featuring D. Martin)!
