I saw this video on failblog, of all places. A bit misplaced, I thought. Neil Gaiman gave a graduation speech at a university to a bunch of arts graduates. He talks about how important it is to make mistakes and learn from them, how important it is to face success, which nobody prepares you for and how to learn from that, too.

Also of grave significance to me is his advice that whoever you are, chances are you’ll come up with something new and some will say it can’t be done because your idea is outside their carefully-crafted model of reality. **If you don’t know what you can’t do, you can do everything**.

Anyway, enough waffle. Watch!
