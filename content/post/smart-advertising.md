I came across thus poster and it’s long overdue. Especially after all the cyclists being killed by lorries. I remember reading about a woman being killed while undertaking a lorry on a left hand corner and the papers and relatives blaming the driver for driving unsafely.

The trouble is that people don’t have common sense and cyclists have a habit of being entitled idiots who assume the road revolves around them. The prevailing culture is that it’s the other road users’ responsibility to keep you safe. Which is, naturally, completely wrong! People need to learn to take responsibility for their actions again.

Here’s hoping for positive change!
