Nick finally OK’d Karen’s video that’s been floating around the Facebooks *in secret (shh)* for the last month or so and I can now officially share it with the world.

Honestly, don’t go to Bali. It’s a  horrible place and there is no fun to be had there whatsoever. It’s really cold, wet, boring and there are no fun people there at all.

Oh wait.
