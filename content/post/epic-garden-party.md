October’s garden party was magical, crazy and exciting!  
 Also, there was fire and pretty lights and awesome people. Skins shot some pictures – check them out here: [Skins’ Blog](http://skinselliott.webs.com/apps/photos/album?albumid=10199153). Here’s a sampler!

 Videos will undoubtedly come soon!
