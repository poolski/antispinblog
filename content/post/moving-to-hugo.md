### I'm moving my blog off Ghost and on to Hugo.

Ghost has grown from being a nice, self-contained blogging engine to a somewhat bigger and heavier-weight platform that requires more and more resources and management. 

For a while, this blog's been sat without any updates as most of my writing has migrated to [Medium](https://medium.com/@poolski). In the meantime, the infrastructure has been hoovering up money for basically doing nothing. Running a web server + attendant SQL instance isn't exactly expensive, but with the money it costs I could buy a fancy dinner every month!

Hence I've made the decision to archive this blog off to Hugo - the overall layout and function remains the same, but now that it's entirely based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), it's all static content and will be blazing fast. 

At some point I may even repurpose this website for personal projects and things, but in the meantime, enjoy the new-found speed and power!
