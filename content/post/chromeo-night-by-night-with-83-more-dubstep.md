My friend Chris Baker was rocking some kickass tunes at the circus jam last night and one of them was this awesome little piece which has been stuck in my head for a good hour now. The bastard played it at the end of his set. Chromeo’s Night By Night has been remixed into something far less cheesy and more awesome. Electronic music cures what ails you!

He’s also DJing at the Imaginarium party in a few weeks – I’ll fish out the URL once I find the flyer. Well worth checking out. Do it!
