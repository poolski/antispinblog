As an interesting mind/attitude exercise, for the next week, I plan to note down one awesome thing that I saw, heard or experienced that day.

You should do the same. It’ll be interesting to see what tickles you and makes you go “yeah that was great!”. To look over a week’s worth of things that made you smile might reveal things about yourself you might not have otherwise found out!

See you in 7 days!
