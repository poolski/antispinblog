I haven’t done a music blog post in a while – mostly I’ve been busy doing work things and scrambling around catching up with people and so forth. I came across this tune being played at work over our Spotify account and it’s wonderfully catchy. Not exactly the reinvention of the wheel in musical terms and the vocals are pretty standard fare, but it’s put together nicely and is great listening nonetheless!
