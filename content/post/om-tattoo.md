I shot this a good while back – about a year ago, in fact – in Bali but never got around to putting it up. It’s a beautiful tattoo a friend has – what makes it special is that it is done by using individual dots instead of continuous ink through a machine. It’s much more intricate and generally gorgeous. I think you’ll agree!
