What on earth possessed the driver of my coach to London to flip on the air conditioning when it’s -3 outside?

Aberdeen was, as usual, lots of fun. Despite our main gig being cancelled last minute, a productive time was had! We made jelly, watched films, caught up with people, entertained some randoms and generally had a good giggle.

Now my mouth is missing its lining after the boiling hot tea I had to ingest to get warm at a service station. 5 more hours and I’m outta here!
