Dumb Ways to Die is by far and away one of the best videos promoting safety I’ve seen. It was created for the Melbourne Metro. The original has since amassed 170 million hits on YouTube and has spawned a bunch of spinoff clips, including a version from Cinesaurus about the Curiosity Rover. Also, there’s a motherfucking Karaoke version available on YouTube and iTunes.

It’s a ridiculously chipper song about dumb ways to die. Also it’s about staying away from train tracks.

Anyway, here is the original. And some others.
