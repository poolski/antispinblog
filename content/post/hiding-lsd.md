I came across a very interesting article on the Guardian’s site which talks about how LSD can make you come to terms with yourself and is not a purely escapist drug, as many believe. An illuminating read, to be sure!

> For myself I used to face terrible scenes of torture, rape and other kinds of human cruelty. I do not know why, but I found myself imagining them again and again both in meditation and with drugs. Perhaps like most people, I began by fighting them and trying to push them away, but LSD will not let you push anything away. You have to face it. And this is, I think, what makes it the ultimate psychedelic. There is no hiding with LSD. You have to face whatever comes up or be overwhelmed by it.
