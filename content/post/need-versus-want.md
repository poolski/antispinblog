I’ve been turned on to this [rather excellent blog](https://sexgeek.wordpress.com/) on all things fun, exciting and non-traditional by a wonderful friend of mine. One of the articles I came across resonates particularly with me as I’m in the process of exploring communication and how it can be a great force for good in relationships. I mean that in every sense of the word, not just romantic, stars-in-the-eyes, oh-god-my-stomach-is-a-flutter way. Here’s a quick excerpt:

> I believe there are really big differences between needing something and wanting something. And I think in our culture, we are often encouraged to express things as “needs” that are actually “wants.” I think this is an unfortunate practice, because it’s rather inaccurate, and inaccuracy is one of those things that often gets in the way of clear communication. Worse, I think it cements pathways of thought in our minds that would do much better to be kept soft and earthy and ripe for change.
