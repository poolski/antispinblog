I saw [this project](http://thisiscolossal.com/2011/01/paper-lakes/) on thisiscolossal.com and Iâ€™m determined to make this into a piece to go on my wall. This is so simple and elegant and, frankly, amazing.

All credit goes to [thisiscolossal](http://thisiscolossal.com/) and [crafterall](http://www.etsy.com/shop/Crafterall?section_id=7688979) for finding and making this!
