Cyrille Humen and Kyle…er… something posted this video a while back and I remember being incredibly impressed with it and amused at its completely light-hearted approach to performance. Whereas many other videos that people post are serious and polished and a real “performance”, this has more of a “hey we got to playing around – check out what we did!” feel!

All in all, a lovely piece of contact juggling!
