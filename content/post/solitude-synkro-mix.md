Solitude released another mix a week and bit ago – all Synkro tracks this time. I’ve been toying with the idea of throwing together a mix all composed of a single artist’s tracks and this has definitely reinforced the idea that I ought to do it!

When I heard it, it made fun things happen in my brain! Specifically, it really reminds me of being at Burning Man. Every time I hear the bass drop at 1:50, I imagine myself hearing that coming from a fat stack of speakers on the Playa with bodies moving to the music. It’s very surreal – no music has affected me this way for a while!

Worth a listen, for sure!
