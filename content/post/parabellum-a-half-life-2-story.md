Over a decade ago, a guy called Rigel wrote a fanfic set in the Half-Life 2 universe, called Parabellum. It was a weekly instalment and ran over the course of about 30 weeks. 

The site has since shut down and trying to find it on the Internet Archive is an exercise in frustration and futility. At the time that they were released, I remember thinking to myself 
> I should save this somewhere, in case it disappears. 

Lo and behold, it did. 

Thankfully, I **did** save it somewhere. It ended up as a 500kb, brokenly-formatted Word document on my computer. 

After much cleaning up and refactoring, I present Parabellum:
