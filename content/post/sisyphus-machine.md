Bruce Shapiro is an artist and zen garden enthusiast with a side hobby in computer controlled motion. So he invented this. The Sisyphus machine. It features a flat bed covered in a thin layer of sand, over which steel ball bearings are guided by magnets under the table’s surface. Over time, it makes beautiful patterns like these.
