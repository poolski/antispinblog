My friend Kristoff re-introduced me to this tune. It’s been kicking around my hard disk for a while now, but it’s been like a splinter at the back of my mind. You know, when you can think of the melody but for the life of you can’t remember what the tune is called. Anyway, the mystery was solved and I’m glad to share this with you.

It’s a beautiful Goa chill track. Play at full screen HD and watch the timelapse photography slide by!
