So a while ago, I posted this lovely video of G doing his thing:

Well, a few days ago, my long-lost twin brother Joe and crazy Scottish hug monkey Cat came down to visit and we went to do the touristy thing in London by way of Buckingham Palace. We got to the Queen Vic fountain in front and got some toys out for photos. 2 hours later, we left with a video and made a lot of people very happy indeed!

It sort of evolved into a tribute to all the awesome people we know and their signature moves (done badly)!
