The more I read Medium, the more I like it. For a change, a site focusing on essays on diverse topics without hyperbolic “You Won’t Believe What Scientists Have Found Inside A Grapefruit!” titles, complete with “Stories You Might Like” sections at the bottom (IFLS, I’m looking at you. You’re great, but stop using third-party traffic referers, please).

Medium’s presentation is clean, text-focused (no annoying sidebars with Things I May Like) and the typography is wonderful. It<span class="text_exposed_show">s homepage lists popular/highly-rated articles beautifully. This article (one of theirs) explains it far better than I could: https://medium.com/who-what-why/fonts-have-feelings-too-1523564d966c</span>
