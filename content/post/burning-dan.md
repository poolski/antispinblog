Burning Dan, a man of great kindness, boundless optimism and unbridled Awesome joined with the Force on the night of the 4th/5th of October. He was a friend to many around the world, a mentor to many more and an inspiration to still more.

Here’s a video of him explaining some things about the world we live in.

He also helped found [hitRECord.org](http://hitrecord.org "hitRECord") with his brother, Joe. It’s hit Joe pretty hard, as well as [Tea Faerie](http://pronoia.org/) and [Thom](http://blog.major-thom.com/ "Major Thom's blog") who are all very close. There’s a huge number of folk contributing everything under the sun on hitRECord [here](http://www.hitrecord.org/records/234697 "Burning Dan"), and I encourage you to join them.

Dan was an awesome person. In light of that, remember a few things:

- Breathe.
- Be awesome to yourself and others.
- There are no “other people”. Anyone can do ANYTHING.
- Don’t worry about influencing the future. Focus on influencing the moment you live in. The future will take care of itself.

And finally, in Joe’s wise words:

> Let’s celebrate him; he’s fucking awesome!
