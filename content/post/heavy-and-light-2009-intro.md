I saw this a while back and it’s the simplest intro to any event I’ve ever seen but it’s the more powerful for it. It’s since been remixed and made awesomer. It’s really really worth watching.

[To Write Love On Her Arms](http://www.twloha.com/) is a charity dedicated to helping people get through depression and the work they do is pretty amazing and you should go check them out and support them!

Also, this film looks to be pretty evocative and moving – I’m intrigued by it
