Joy! Another EVE post you cry!

Meh. Trinity II is upon us now. For those not in the know (or in the care), Trinity is the new shiny all-singing, all-dancing graphics overhaul that EVE has undergone. It comes in 2 flavours: classic and premium. The difference is that the premium version (which is free, oddly) comes with the aforementioned shiny new things like new ship models, station models and the like as well as the new modular interface (finally). The classic one comes with the shiny new interface… and that’s about it.

Here’s a comparison shot:

shiny, no?

Anyway, I’m not here to talk about that.

I’m here to chat about the ongoing (exciting as hell) war between the RSF and BoB. We [GoonSwarm] and the Redswarm Federation in general have reached the stage where BoB have stopped (they never really started) fighting us proper – mano e mano as it were. It’s positively infuriating to see them do it. They will not engage unless with a superiority both in numbers and shiptypes. This means we get precious few fights out of them and this leads me on to my point. There are too many blues out there. To wit: blues are anyone that is set to friendly status with the alliance.

At this stage I’d like to say that **MY OPINIONS ARE MY OWN AND DO NOT IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM REPRESENT THE OPINIONS OF THE GOONFLEET DIRECTORATE, OFFICERS OR GOONFLEET AS A WHOLE**. Before people decided to reset standings to us and so on.

By setting half the universe friendly we’ve all become bored much more frequently because now-a-days nobody wants to actually fight us. Other than mercenary corps that have been hired to harass us in Empire. Which is a bit pathetic, really!

So come on, enemies, stop shitposting on CAOD and come fight us instead of bragging about how we’re “not winning” despite having lost near enough 70% of the space you once held. I have heard whisperings from the BoB forums:

> We are Bob. nothing will break us. even if NOL would lie in ashes we would still bring torture and death to our enemies as roaming ghosts, never resting and never forgiving! We dont even need a home. All we need are each other!

I beg of you, oh mighty BoB, PLEASE do this. We would like nothing more than to fight. We don’t care about the cost of the ships or the distance traveled but God, give us a fight and we’ll respect you slightly more. Well, maybe not. But still.
