Here is where I write about myself.

I get up to lots of things! I am:

- [A photographer](http://flickr.com/photos/poolski "My Flickr photos")
- A firespinner
- A DJ
- An Internet keeper-upper.

If you are interested in using any of my photos, either here or on [flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/poolski "My Flickr"), **please** get in touch and ask me. I will probably say yes, unless you are a Nigerian general with $30,000,000,000 that you have inherited and wish to share with me.
